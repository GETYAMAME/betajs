BetaJS is a 'lightweight' Javascript Framework with several independent, combinable Modules for writing full stack web applications.

Some Modules have dependencies on other currently well-established web technologies: NodesJS, JQuery and Socket.io

One of the goals of BetaJS is to be rapidly and easily deployable for demos and prototypes,
with the added benefit of being able to scale these into production ready Products
